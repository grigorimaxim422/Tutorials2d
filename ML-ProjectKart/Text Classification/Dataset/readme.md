## **DATASET**
You don't need to downlaod any dataset
- For Suicide_tendency_model, I have used dataset present online on github. Link : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laxmimerit/twitter-suicidal-intention-dataset/master/twitter-suicidal_data.csv
- For fetching live tweets, one needs to create a csv file containing credentials to access twitter tokens, demonstration of which is shown in this particular youtube video:  https://youtu.be/ujId4ipkBio

**Car Price Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to predict the price of different cars using the information contained in this dataset.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Preparation
- Step 3: Data visualization
- Step 4: Data Training
- Step 5: Model Creation
- Step 6: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- warnings
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  96.84
 ``` 
- By using Ridge Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  93.15
 ```
- By using Lasso Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  66.77
 ``` 
- By using Decision Tree Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  99.99
 ``` 
**Conclusion:**
- Conclusion: Accuracy of Lasso Regression model is about 67%.

- Whereas accuracy of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Decision Tree Classifier are above 90%.

- And the Accuracy of the Decision Tree Classifier is highest which is almost 100%, so it is efficient among all.

## ‚ùî**ABOUT OPENCV**

OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. 
Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. 
The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License.

## üìó**OBJECT DETECTION USING OPENCV**

### Haar Cascade:
Basically, the Haar cascade technique is an approach based on machine learning where we use a lot of positive and negative images to train the classifier to classify between the images. Haar cascade classifiers are considered as the effective way to do object detection with the OpenCV library. Now, let's understand the concept of positive and negative images that we have discussed earlier:

* Positive images: These are the images that contain the objects which we want to be identified from the classifier.
* Negative Images: These are the images that do not contain any object that we want to be detected by the classifier, and these can be images of everything else.

## :pushpin: **Implementation of Object Detection with Python OpenCV:**
We have to install first some important libraries in our system as it is an important requirement for doing object detection tasks. We have to perform the following tasks for performing object detection:

1. Installation of OpenCV library
2. Import the image/video
3. Recognition or object detection in the image
4. Create bounding box around the object
5. Return the video frame/image.

## :page_facing_up: **CONCLUSION**
* Multiple types and numbers of objects in a single frame can be detected using OpenCV. 
All you need to do is to add multiple layers of cascade classifiers in the program, as per your requirement. 
You can experiment around with different classifiers using the same basic template.
